# Why We Are Building Afritech

Afritech is a public record of technology companies in the African continent. This initiative was started to fulfill a need to have a repository of current and past tech companies that have been established over time. While still in its early stages, the goal of Afritech is to enable the access of information about African technology companies accessible to Africans themselves as well as anyone interested in the ever-changing tech landscape within the continent. 

## What We Want in a Public Database

To be useful, we intend to start with having a database that can provide fine-grained search and filtering capabilities with the initial filtereable fileds being `Company Name` , `Year Founded`, `Industries`, `Sub Industries` , by `Country`, by `Stage`, by `Status` - is it `active` , `inactive` or `acquired`.  One can begin by asking the question: 

> How many companies operating in Kenya within the Agricultural industry have been established within the past 10 years but are no longer active?

Answering this question, and others similar to this is our primary baseline for a usable product.

## Alternative Platforms

There are several other platforms to source similar information such as [Startuplist Africa](https://startuplist.africa/), [Seed Table](https://www.seedtable.com/best-startups-in-africa), [Stears](https://www.stears.co/) and [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/). These sites offer similar experiences that are majorly geared towards investors therefore prioritizing. We would like to widen the market for research into african tech companies to include not only investors but also everyday africans, historians, entrepreneurs themselves so they can more deeply understand the tech landscape within the continent. 

If you share in this vision, we invite you to have a look and give us feedback as we keep building.
